# college-enquirychatbot

## Overview
This project leverages advanced technologies to create a chatbot that assists with inquiries about engineering and polytechnic institutes. The chatbot provides real-time responses and information on admissions, fees, scholarships, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Builds the interactive web interface for the chatbot.
- **Google Gemini AI**: Provides natural language understanding and generates responses.
- **Pinecone**: Manages and retrieves vector embeddings for relevant information.
- **Sentence Transformers**: Converts text queries into vector embeddings.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Scrapes data from web pages for integration.
- **JSON**: Formats and stores data extracted from web pages.
- **Python**: The programming language used for integrating all technologies.

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the chatbot through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Query Processing**: User queries are transformed into vector embeddings.
3. **Context Retrieval**: Vector embeddings are used to fetch relevant information from Pinecone.
4. **Response Generation**: Responses are generated by Google Gemini AI based on the retrieved context.
5. **Output**: Responses are displayed to users in the chat interface.
